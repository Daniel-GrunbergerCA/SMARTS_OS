# Welcome to SMARTS ! #

This project is an simple implementation of a Real Time System.
It was mainly done for learning purposes.  

There are three implementation of scheduling algorithms:  
* edf  
* round robin  
* rms  

It also supports the priority inheritance protocol, and uses a mutex with an priority queue.  

Enjoy !
